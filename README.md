# Chronicle
**Chronicle** is a Java-based desktop application that brings AI-driven RPG characters to life. Unlike standard chatbots, Chronicle uses a **RAG** system powered by Apache Lucene to give characters long-term memory. It forces the LLM to respond in a strict JSON format to drive a dynamic UI, including emotional portraits and a "thought log" window.
